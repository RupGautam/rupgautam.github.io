Configure and deploy two applications, a frontend and a backend, to a multi-environment setup (development, staging, and production) on AWS. Using Terraform/CDK, Kubernetes (EKS) and Docker in this task.

The script is designed to make the frontend application public and the backend service private. Implemented auto-scaling and auto-healing for the applications, and ensuring that the applications are properly monitored.
