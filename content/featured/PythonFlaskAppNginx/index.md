The py-flask-ansible-docker repository is a project that demonstrates how to dockerize a Flask application, add nginx as a reverse proxy, and set up CI/CD pipelines using Ansible.

The project uses Python for both frontend and backend and utilizes Ansible for infrastructure management. By adding nginx as a reverse proxy, the project ensures that the Flask application is accessible through a secure and scalable web server. The repository is useful for developers who want to learn how to containerize their Flask applications, add nginx as a reverse proxy, and automate their deployment using Ansible.
